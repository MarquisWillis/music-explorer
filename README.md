# project-1: Music Explorer

## Description

## Motivation
```
As a group thinking carefully about what we should do we thought of the project guidelines and thought a Music explorer would not only be challenging but also fun and something we all love. Music Explorer is something that is not very common. Knowing that we decided to try it out little did we know this project would take on a mind of its own.

## What problem does it solve

Music Explorer solves the problem of finding new music/artists, seeing where they are playing next and time.
